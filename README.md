## The Problem: Why You Can't Export WhatsApp Channel Messages

If you've searched for *"how to save messages from a whatsapp channel"*, you probably noticed that the standard **"Export Chat"** feature is completely disabled for Channels. WhatsApp built Channels as a one-way broadcast feed, meaning there is **no official bulk export tool** or chat-backup option for channel history.

WhatsApp Channel Exporter is designed for the Channels "Updates" feed rather than private chats or groups. It reads the Channel view that is already open in your authorized WhatsApp Web session and creates a timestamped local archive.

## Who is WA Channel Exporter for?

WA Channel Exporter is for people who need to **preserve, analyze, or document** what was published on WA Channels over time:

- **Journalists and researchers:** Preserve public statements, crisis updates, health information, and other channel posts in time-stamped archives for reporting and research.
- **OSINT analysts and investigators:** Capture public updates and media consistently for repeatable analysis, internal reports, and documented investigations.
- **Human-rights NGOs and legal teams:** Keep organized local records of public statements, conflict updates, hate speech, or other material relevant to advocacy and review.
- **Brands and marketing teams:** Track competitor announcements, product launches, pricing changes, and campaigns shared through WA Channels.
- **Channel admins and creators:** Maintain an offline copy of your own posts and media for backup, repurposing, newsletters, or long-term archives.
- **Compliance and records teams:** Export public channel communications into consistent local archives that can be retained and reviewed under your organization’s records process.

Archives document what the browser captured at the time of scanning; they are not automatically tamper-evident and do not guarantee legal admissibility.

## FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will my WhatsApp account get banned or flagged for using this?**
WA Channel Exporter is designed to be **read-only**. It reads public broadcast posts already loaded on your screen and does not send automated messages or touch private contacts. No third-party tool can guarantee how a platform will respond, so use it in accordance with WhatsApp's terms.

**Q: Does this Chrome extension download WhatsApp Channel media (photos and videos)?**
Yes! As a dedicated media-downloader, the extension automatically fetches the images, videos, and voice notes visible in the channel and organizes them chronologically in a local `media/` folder.

**Q: Why should I use this instead of standard WhatsApp backup tools?**
Standard chat-backup tools and popular Chrome extensions are designed for the "Chats" tab. They cannot read the "Updates" broadcast feed. This extension was built from the ground up exclusively for WhatsApp Channels.

**Q: Is it safe? Does it steal my data?**
WA Channel Exporter is designed to process everything **locally** in your browser. It does not send your channel data, messages, or phone number to an external server. Review the open-source code and use the extension in accordance with WhatsApp's terms.

**Q: What format does the WhatsApp Channel export into?**
Your export comes neatly packaged in a `.zip` file containing:
- A beautiful `index.html` file to view the channel offline.
- A `posts.csv` file for excel-export and tabular analysis.
- A `posts.md` file for note-taking apps like Notion or Obsidian.
- A `media/` folder with all images and videos.

Alternatively, you can select the **"PDF"** option to generate a standalone formatted PDF document!

## Archive Layout

A successful ZIP archive contains a clean, human- and machine-friendly structure:

```text
{channel}_{scope}_{start}_to_{end}.zip
├── index.html             # offline browser viewer with embedded media & lightbox
├── manifest.json          # counts, date range, status, completion reason, and scope
├── media-report.json      # downloaded, unavailable, failed, and skipped media audit
├── posts.jsonl            # newline-delimited JSON (schema v2) for developers & AI
├── posts.csv              # spreadsheet-compatible tabular export
├── posts.md               # readable Markdown archive with inline media embeds

## Honest Completeness & Audit

A successful button click is not treated as proof of a complete history. The archive reports exactly what it found and what it missed in the `manifest.json` and `media-report.json` files. 

If you cancel the scan early, or if WhatsApp Web fails to load older posts, the tool honestly reports a **Partial archive**. A partial archive does not mean that missing content never existed, but simply that WhatsApp Web did not make it available to the scraper at that moment.

## Privacy and Rights

WA Channel Exporter is designed for content that you are authorized to view and save. Exporting content does not grant republication rights. You are responsible for respecting the rights of Channel owners, contributors, and people shown in media.

The extension is independent and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by WhatsApp or Meta**. It does not bypass login, recover deleted posts, access private material without authorization, or promise every historical post or media file.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node scripts/test-exports.mjs
node scripts/test-mv3.js
node scripts/test-browser-fixture.js
```

The build creates `wa-channel-exporter.zip` and a loadable `dist/` directory.
