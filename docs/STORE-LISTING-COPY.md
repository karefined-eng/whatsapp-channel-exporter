**Language:** English (US)  
**Category:** Productivity  
**Prepared:** 2026-09-25

This document is the canonical copy source for the `1.3.1` store submissions. The Chrome and Edge packages contain the same extension behavior. Their manifest descriptions differ only because the stores apply different description constraints.

## Chrome Web Store

### Short description

> Export WhatsApp Channel posts and available media from WhatsApp Web into a local, organized ZIP archive.

This summary is **104 characters**, within Chrome's 132-character summary limit.

### Detailed description

> WA Channel Exporter is a local-first browser extension for saving authorized WhatsApp Channel content from WhatsApp Web into a portable archive.
>
> Select a date range, scan the currently loaded Channel feed, and export posts, available media, or both. The extension runs in your browser session and does not upload Channel content to a server.
>
> **Included in each archive**
>
> - An offline HTML viewer with a WhatsApp-style dark theme.
> - Images, videos, audio, and voice notes organized in date-based folders when they are available to WhatsApp Web.
> - Markdown, CSV, and JSONL records for reading, searching, analysis, or import into other tools.
> - A PDF export for a readable document version of the selected posts.
> - A media report that distinguishes downloaded, unavailable, failed, and skipped items.
> - Export metadata and validation results so you can understand the archive's scope and completeness.
>
> **Privacy by design**
>
> Processing happens locally in the browser. The extension does not require a separate login, send messages, modify your WhatsApp account, or upload Channel content to its own server. It requests access only to WhatsApp Web so it can read the Channel feed you choose to export.
>
> **Important limitation**
>
> WhatsApp Web exposes the content loaded in the current session. An export may therefore be partial if older posts or media are not loaded, have expired, or are no longer retrievable. The archive reports these conditions instead of presenting an incomplete export as complete.
>
> WA Channel Exporter is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by WhatsApp or Meta.

### Single-purpose statement

> Exports posts and available media from a WhatsApp Channel opened in WhatsApp Web into a local archive selected by the user.

### Privacy disclosure

> The extension reads Channel posts and media exposed by the user's active WhatsApp Web session solely to create the export requested by the user. Exported content is processed locally and written to files selected through the browser download flow. The extension does not sell, advertise against, or transmit Channel content to a third-party server. Settings such as export preferences may be stored locally in the browser.

### Permission justifications

| Permission | Justification |
|---|---|
| `storage` | Stores scan-progress and download-status metadata locally so the extension can track user-requested export operations. |
| `downloads` | Saves the ZIP or PDF export to the user's local file system after the user starts an export. |
| `activeTab` | Owner review required: no direct `activeTab` API use was found in the current implementation; confirm necessity before using a permission justification in the Dashboard. |
| `scripting` | Starts the user-requested scan and reads the WhatsApp Channel feed in the active WhatsApp Web tab. |
| `sidePanel` | Provides the persistent export interface beside WhatsApp Web. |
| `tabs` | Checks that the selected tab is WhatsApp Web before allowing a scan to start. |
| `https://web.whatsapp.com/*` | Limits content access to WhatsApp Web, where the user selects the Channel to export. |

### Reviewer notes

> To test the extension, use a WhatsApp Web session authorized to access a Channel. Open the WA Channel Exporter side panel, review the in-product disclosure, select its acknowledgment checkbox, then choose a short date range and start a scan. No project account or project-supplied WhatsApp credentials are provided.
>
> The extension reads the selected Channel view and retrieves available media from URLs exposed by WhatsApp Web. It does not send messages, modify the WhatsApp account, or upload Channel content to a server operated by the project. Content that WhatsApp Web does not expose is reported as unavailable or failed rather than silently presented as complete.

## Microsoft Edge Add-ons

### Short description

> Export WhatsApp Channel posts and available media from WhatsApp Web into a local, organized ZIP archive.

### Detailed description

> WA Channel Exporter is a local-first, read-only extension for exporting authorized WhatsApp Channel posts and available media from WhatsApp Web.
>
> Open a Channel, choose a date range, and use the side panel to scan the content currently available in your WhatsApp Web session. Export posts, media, or both into a portable ZIP archive. The extension also creates a PDF document when a formatted document export is useful.
>
> **Archive contents**
>
> - A self-contained offline HTML viewer with a WhatsApp-style dark theme.
> - Date-organized folders for downloaded images, videos, audio, and voice notes.
> - Markdown, CSV, and JSONL records for reading, searching, analysis, or import into other tools.
> - A PDF representation of the selected posts.
> - `media-report.json` with per-item downloaded, unavailable, failed, or skipped statuses.
> - Export metadata and validation results describing the selected Channel, date range, counts, and completeness.
>
> **Local processing and privacy**
>
> The extension processes the export in the browser. It does not require a separate login, send messages, modify the user's WhatsApp account, or upload Channel content to an application server. Access is limited to WhatsApp Web so the extension can read the Channel feed selected by the user.
>
> **Availability limitation**
>
> WhatsApp Web only exposes content loaded in the current session. Older posts or media may be unavailable, expired, or affected by platform behavior. WA Channel Exporter records these conditions in the archive and does not claim that an export is complete when the source content was not available.
>
> WA Channel Exporter is an independent project and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by WhatsApp or Meta.

The Chrome Web Store Store Listing form exposes a Support URL, not a separate support-email field. Keep the email separate from that URL field; use it only in public contact copy or a dashboard field explicitly labeled for an email address.

## Accuracy notes for submission

The copy intentionally says **available media** and **currently loaded feed**. These qualifiers are important because WhatsApp Web can omit older posts or expire media. Do not replace them with claims of guaranteed complete historical backup.

The copy also describes the extension as **independent** and does not use WhatsApp or Meta branding to imply endorsement. Keep the privacy-policy URL, permission justifications, and dashboard data-use declarations synchronized with this document before submission.
